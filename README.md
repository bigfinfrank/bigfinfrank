# Hello!

## You're probably here for:

### My configs for source engine games

- [Counter-Strike 2](https://github.com/bigfinfrank/cs2) 
- [Team Fortress 2](https://github.com/bigfinfrank/tf2)
- [Garry's Mod](https://github.com/bigfinfrank/gmod)
- [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://github.com/bigfinfrank/csgo)

### But you might've come here to see

- The [tweaks](https://github.com/bigfinfrank/gametweaks) I make to various games
- My other CS2 related shenanigans such as my modified version of a [kz vscript](https://github.com/bigfinfrank/cs2-kz-lua) and other [miscellaneous stuff](https://github.com/bigfinfrank/misc-cs2) I've messed around with
- My [commit tracker](https://github.com/bigfinfrank/RustCommitsToDiscord) for the *game* Rust, to see facepunch commits in a Discord server via a webhook.
- The process behind making my lil cactus profile picture [as high quality as possible](https://github.com/bigfinfrank/cactas) despite being a GIF

## If there's something else I can help you with:

Feel free to reach out to me, any of the following will work but you'll get **faster responses with methods higher up the list**:

1. My Discord is [@femboyfin](https://discord.com/users/386945522608373785), I accept all friend requests at least temporarily, so you should get a reply pretty much as soon as I'm available.
2. You can shoot me an email at [curing_haunt672@simplelogin.com](mailto:curing_haunt672@simplelogin.com), this will forward to my main email which I try to check at least once per night, but you might get missed or get a delayed response, I don't get email notifications!
3. My Steam is [/id/bigfinfrank](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198208579485/), here there's a decent chance you'll just get ignored both because I get regular friend requests from scammers/bots and because I don't check my steam messages intentionally pretty much ever.
